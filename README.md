## ```üìù``` CODXO Given Tasks & Internship Projects:

This repository showcases the projects developed during my Web Development Internship at Codxo in June 2024. Throughout the internship, I focused on enhancing my skills in NextJS, ReactJS, and TailwindCSS by building the following key projects:

- **Portfolio-Website:** A professional portfolio website designed with Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, and SASS. It features a seamless and intuitive layout, animated transitions with Framer Motion, and integration with the Resend API for contact functionalities.

- **WeatherVue:** A feature-rich weather application built with Next.js 14 and OpenWeatherMap API. It offers a responsive design, real-time weather data, detailed weather displays, and forecasting features for an engaging user experience.

- **ToDo-List:** A sleek ToDo List app developed using ReactJS. This application includes a landing page, dark and light theme switch support, fully implemented CRUD operations, and local storage support.

These projects demonstrate my ability to create responsive, user-friendly web applications with a strong focus on UI/UX design and functionality. Additionally, I created a landing hub for showcasing these projects and the certificates earned during the internship.
